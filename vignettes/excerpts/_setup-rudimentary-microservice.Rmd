1.  Deploy the Microservice infrastructure

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
microservices::use_microservice(path = ".")
remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
devtools::document()
```

2.  Spin-up the microservice by running
    `source("./inst/entrypoints/plumber-background.R")`

3.  Run the microservice unit-test by pressing Ctrl+Shift+T on Windows

Congratulations! You have added a microservice to your application and tested
that it works.

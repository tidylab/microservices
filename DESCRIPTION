Description: 'Microservice' architectural style is an approach to
    developing a single application as a suite of small services, each
    running in its own process and communicating with lightweight
    mechanisms, often an 'HTTP' resource 'API'. These services are built
    around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully
    automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized
    management of these services, which may be written in different
    programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
